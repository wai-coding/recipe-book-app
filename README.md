# 🥗 React Recipe Book (CRUD Learning Project)

A React-based application developed to practice and master CRUD operations within a component-based architecture. This project serves as a functional prototype for managing a recipe collection.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to implement the four basic functions of persistent storage:

- Create: Adding new recipes to the collection.

- Read: Displaying recipes dynamically from state.

- Update: Editing existing recipe titles or details.

- Delete: Removing recipes from the list.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Framework: React.js

- State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

- Styling: CSS3 (Desktop-first)

# 📌 Current Status & Known Limitations

- Data Structure: Currently utilizes a "poor" or simplified database/JSON structure. Expanding the data schema to include full ingredients and instructions is a priority for the next sprint.

- Responsiveness: Not currently mobile-friendly; designed for desktop use only.

- Persistence: Data currently resets on page refresh (unless LocalStorage/Firebase is implemented).

# 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] Refactor CSS with Media Queries for Mobile Responsiveness.

- [ ] Enhance the data model to support complex recipe instructions.

- [ ] Connect to Firebase or MongoDB for permanent data storage.
